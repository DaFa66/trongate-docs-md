# Using The Module Import Wizard


There's actually not much to say here! It's very easy. Suppose you want to take a module from 'site A' and add it onto 'site B'. In that kind of situation all you have to do is copy and paste. That's it.


Here's a video demonstration:

> [!CAUTION]
> Never use the Module Import Wizard on a live website. For improved security it's best to carry out module imports on your 'localhost' environment and then upload once you're happy with your new module.


> [!TIP]
> **Best Practices**
>
> If you have a module that requires database tables, export SQL files (from your donor database) and add those (.sql) files into the new module. The activate the wizard, simply navigate to your base URL followed by the name of your new module directory.
